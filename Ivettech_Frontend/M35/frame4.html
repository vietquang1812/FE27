					<p class="content-text">
						It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
						the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
						of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
						distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
						here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
						packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
						model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
						sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
						years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
						and the like).
					</p><br>
					<p class="content-note">
						"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,
						consectetur, adipisci velit..." "There is no one who loves pain
						itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it
						is pain..."

							What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
							Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur
							roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of
							Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused
							on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
							conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
							<br /><br />
							Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his
							Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work
							focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from
							the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function
							of certopsid horns and frills.

					Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
					American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by five
					years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of
					Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of
					Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
					Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
					paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
					interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
					morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
					<br /><br />
					In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has
					conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
					Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the
					on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently
					completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life,
					which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their
					worlds to date.
