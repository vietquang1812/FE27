							What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
							Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur
							roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of
							Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has
							focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs
							and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
							<br /><br />
							Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his
							Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work
							focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from
							the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function
							of certopsid horns and frills.

							Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
							American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by
							five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York
							College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the
							University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant
							professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator
							of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
							His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics,
							functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
							<br /><br />
							In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson
							has conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
							Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also
							the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and
							recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the
							Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of
							dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
